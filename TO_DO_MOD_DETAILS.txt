Next Update Patch Notes:

1.25g
Gold bag overhaul
Removed gold bag drops from non-boss creeps
Bosses (and mini-bosses) now drop a single gold chest (bag) worth 2500g (1000g)
Total chest/bag gold earned per player before the start of infinite waves is now 18000g
4p/5p maps: the new total is roughly the same as the average total before the changes
2p map: the new total is roughly double of the average total before the changes
These changes remove the substantial variation in gold earned from bags due to different wave combinations and different numbers of lanes on 4p/5p and 2p maps
Each money creep now drops a single gold coin worth 200g (same total gold value as before)
Rapier Ogre now drops a 2500g gold chest
Gold coins/bags/chests are no longer selleable

Cursed Rapier: health drain reduced from 6% to 5%; cooldown reduced from 5s to 3s; active ability no longer affects Spirit Bear; active modifier is now properly removed on unequip
