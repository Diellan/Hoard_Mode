Next Update Patch Notes:

1.25e
All Exalted Items buffed and recipe costs increased
Sacred Trident illusion fix
Willful Resonance redesigned to fix lag; now splashes some of the wielder's base attack damage as magic damage around the target and adds magic damage to the main attack
Cursed Rapier redesigned; now drains 6% of maximum health per second, but increases damage bonus by 20% of the amount drained; while active, the wielder is protected from all physical and magical damage
Disabled penalties until Valve fixes the crash bugs
Fix Ember Spirit's Fiery Remnants
